# Ultrawide UI Overhaul

Current release: **2.2.0**

RED4ext plugin (`BlackPillarsRemover`) that prevents Cyberpunk 2077's fullscreen compositor from
adding 16:9 side pillars when an ultrawide menu or background is intentionally
laid out across a display from 2:1 through 32:9.

The plugin does not move widgets and does not alter menu layout by itself.
Widget placement is handled separately by the CET script in
`cet/UltrawideUIOverhaul/init.lua`. The native coordinator is in
`cet/BlackPillarsCoordinator/init.lua`. The native plugin registers
`UWMapSetBlackBarsSuppressed(Bool)`:

- `false`: keep the game's stock fullscreen fit and side pillars;
- `true`: preserve the physical ultrawide rectangle for qualifying fullscreen
  compositions.

## Features

- Full-width 21:9 and 32:9 world map with synchronized map geometry, markers,
  district outlines and GPS path;
- expanded Backpack, Stash, Crafting, Gallery and Shards layouts that use the added
  horizontal workspace instead of merely extending their backgrounds;
- ultrawide backgrounds and repositioned edge widgets across the vanilla
  fullscreen menus, popup views and Breach Protocol;
- coordinated stock pillars during startup, loading screens, the main menu and
  gameplay;
- ratio-aware support covering 2:1, 21:9, intermediate ultrawide and 32:9
  modes, including 2880x1440, 1920x816, 2560x1000, 2560x1080, 3440x1440
  and 3200x900 tests;
- optional UI compatibility for Cleaner Main Menu and Pause Menu, Preem Menu
  StealthRunner and Revised Backpack.

## Compatibility

The hook is version-locked to Cyberpunk 2077 2.31. It checks the expected bytes
at the target RVA and refuses to install on an unknown executable. A game update
may require a new RVA/signature before the plugin can be used safely.

## Version 2.2.0

- Added proportional 2:1 layout support, validated at 2880x1440 and suitable
  for equivalent modes such as 3840x1920.
- Interpolated narrow-ultrawide margins, work areas and item-grid geometry
  between the vanilla 16:9 canvas and the established 21:9 layouts.
- Added ratio-aware Revised Backpack columns and preview sizing below 21:9,
  while preserving its validated 21:9 composition on wider displays.

## Version 2.1.0

- Added a full ultrawide Stash overhaul with ratio-aware player and storage
  grids, expanded filters, optional Stash Search placement and dynamic sorting
  dropdown positioning.
- Isolated the Flatline screen from shared ultrawide Pause Menu and Gallery
  transformations so its animated layout remains vanilla.

## Version 2.0.0

- Turned the project into a full ultrawide UI overhaul rather than a
  background-only extension.
- Expanded the vanilla Backpack item grid and repositioned its filters,
  search, sorting and dropdown controls across the available width.
- Expanded the Crafting recipe grid with ratio-aware columns and corrected
  its scrolling and button-hint boundaries.
- Added optional Revised Backpack support, including expanded list columns,
  corrected text wrapping, full-row selection effects and larger item and
  garment previews.
- Expanded Gallery to use the available width and dynamically show 14 images
  per page at 21:9 and 20 at 32:9.
- Expanded the Shards reader and its text wrapping across the remaining
  screen space.
- Added ultrawide treatment for Breach Protocol and its tutorial overlay.
- Added coverage for Reset Attributes, Gallery viewer, Journal detail and
  Database popup views.
- Added configured-resolution detection to the native plugin for low-height
  ultrawide modes such as 1920x816, with a live game-window fallback.
- Preserved controller-stick pointer input while removing fullscreen pillars.
- Kept all diagnostic and development probes disabled in the release build.

## Version 1.2.2

- Prevented main-menu discovery retries from spilling into the first in-game
  menu when Skip Main Menu or a similar startup mod is used.
- Improved pillar-state recovery and menu lifecycle reliability.

## Version 1.2.1

- Fixed controller-stick pointer input being blocked by the native fullscreen
  composition hook.

## Version 1.2.0

- Added full 32:9 support across all covered menus and the world map.
- Added ratio-aware placement for edge widgets, button hints and decorative
  elements.
- Generalized SAVE / LOAD layout corrections for both 21:9 and 32:9.
- Improved MODS and MOD SETTINGS list positioning on ultrawide displays.
- Added support for the 3200x900 custom 32:9 test resolution.
- Preserved the validated 21:9 layouts without regressions.

## Version 1.1.0

- Added Preem Menu compatibility.
- Added dynamic main-menu scene detection for alternate backgrounds.
- Added Skip Time ultrawide coverage.
- Preserved the correct pillar state across CET Reload All Mods.
- Improved main-menu timing and lifecycle reliability.
- Added and validated 2560x1080 support.

## Build

Requirements:

- Windows x64;
- Visual Studio 2019 or newer with the C++ desktop workload;
- a local checkout of [RED4ext.SDK](https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext.SDK).

The build script expects the SDK at `native/deps/RED4ext.SDK` by default and
accepts an alternative path:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/WopsS/RED4ext.SDK native/deps/RED4ext.SDK
.\native\build.ps1
```

To use another SDK location:

```powershell
.\native\build.ps1 -SdkPath D:\deps\RED4ext.SDK
```

The DLL is written to `native/build/BlackPillarsRemover.dll`.

## Installation

Copy the resulting DLL to:

`Cyberpunk 2077/red4ext/plugins/BlackPillarsRemover/BlackPillarsRemover.dll`

Copy the CET layout script to:

`Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/UltrawideUIOverhaul/init.lua`

Copy the coordinator to:

`Cyberpunk 2077/bin/x64/plugins/cyber_engine_tweaks/mods/BlackPillarsCoordinator/init.lua`

The CET coordinator is optional for the native plugin itself, but is required
to switch pillars at the correct menu/loading lifecycle points.

## License

The native source is released under the MIT License. `RED4ext.SDK` remains under
its own license and is intentionally not vendored in this repository.
